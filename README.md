# Covid-19-Detector
Covid-19 XRay Detector

This project was made on behalf of a subject on our 4th year of the Master's Degree on Data Science. It's goal is to achieve a model viable enough to produce good results on distinguishing cases of Pneumonia, Covid-19 and the absence of any of these. Due to the lack of a single source of data to use to train our models, we used a data-generator from "COVID-Net: A Tailored Deep Convolutional Neural Network Design for Detection of COVID-19 Cases from Chest Radiography Images", made by Linda Wang, Zhong Qiu Lin and Alexander Wong. Link here: <https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net>. The only part we used is the data-generator provided, with some modifications to attend our needs. Thank you to all the participant of the COVID-Net for their hard-work.
