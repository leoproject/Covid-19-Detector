# Covid-19-Detector
Covid-19 XRay Detector

This project was made on behalf of a subject on our 4th year of the Master's Degree on Data Science. It's goal is to achieve a model viable enough to produce good results on distinguishing cases of Pneumonia, Covid-19 and the absence of any of these. Due to the lack of a single source of data to use to train our models, we used a data-generator from "COVID-Net: A Tailored Deep Convolutional Neural Network Design for Detection of COVID-19 Cases from Chest Radiography Images", made by Linda Wang, Zhong Qiu Lin and Alexander Wong. Link here: <https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net>. The only part we used was the data-generator provided but with some modifications to attend our needs. Thank you to all the participants of the COVID-Net for their hard-work on making it this far. The reason we didn't simply fork the main repository was to make it simpler for evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset we used, as explained above, was generated using a script from the **COVID-Net** repository. The file was then uploaded to my personal drive, where we must unzip it in order to use it. Link for the dataset: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EtA92aU1GmcRCR00hTxmyC2kfQIEYx-L

## Models
This section is about the models created by group 7 for the work of detecting COVID-19 in x-ray images. All notebooks with their respective model follow the pipeline exposed in the standard notebook.
