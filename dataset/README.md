# Dataset

## How to generate the datasets used

The original dataset can be created by following the instructions on the original project this was based on (more info on the main page), but also simply running the 
[create_COVIDx_v3.ipynb.ipynb](dataset/create_COVIDx_v3.ipynb) notebook. 

The balanced one can be generated by running this [notebook](dataset/data_augmentation.ipynb).
